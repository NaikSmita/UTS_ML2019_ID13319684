        "Face Recognition system is technology which identifies the person in varying conditions.  It is one of the emerging concepts which is considered to be the hottest topic in the technical field. In recent times many researches have been conducted to employ the benefits of the Face recognition system in mobile platforms and other forms of technology. This system typically used to get access control of security. This fascinated me to review Face Recognition topic to understand the algorithms behind image processing, problems and its limitations\n",

        "The research was conducted to develop a Face recognition system which is insensitive to high variation of light and facial appearance. The paper focused variation in lightning which includes intensity, direction and number of light sources.  Adopting an example of pattern classification approach, they have considered every pixel as a coordinate in a high dimensional space.  They have used the perception considering the face is Lambertian surface without shadowing and observed that every image of face with fixed pose in varying illumination which is lying in the 3D linear surface. However, the same person with different facial expression and appearance when light source illuminates the face from different directions and can produce self-shadowing.  Since the face are not true Lambertian surface, images will deviate from the linear surface. \n",
        "So, the approaches described in the paper has two observation:\n",
        "1.  Images of Lambertian surface in varying illumination with fixed viewpoint lie in 3D high dimensional image space.\n",
        "2. Because of the region, there exists shadowing, specularities and different facial        expression gives huge deviation in image to image results in image unsuitable for recognition.\n",
        " Based on which observations, reached a significantly lower dimensional feature space which excludes both light direction and facial expression. The research depends upon the projection method in which projection directions that are orthogonal to the within class scatter while maintaining discriminability. The algorithm Fisherfaces a derivative of Fisher’s Linear Discriminant (FLD).  The proposed method maximises the ratio of between -class to the within class scatter. FLD is a classical technique to achieve pattern recognition, developed by Robert Fisher which has been applied in four different ways in computer vision and face recognition. The proposed another technique Eigenface technique which has similar computational requirements and this technique is based on linear projecting image on low dimensional subspace. But this Eigenface method uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. \n",

        "Article states set of images of different faces with person’s identity considering learning set of data and unlabelled data set considering test data of same group of people. The article proposed 4 methods to solve pattern recognition \n",
        "\n",
        "1. Correlation method which employs nearest neighbour classifier is the image space where test data best corelates with training data if it has unit variance and zero normalisation. \n",
        "\n",
        "2.Eigenface is commonly used method for pattern recognition over correlation which requires large storage and computationally very expensive. The implementation of Eigenface reduces the linear projection and increasing the scatter of all projected samples by using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The drawback of Eigenface is the maximum scatter of the within-class scatter along with the between class scatter. The increase of within class scatter is later ignored to retain PCA technique in Eigenface.\n",
        " \n",
        "3. Linear subspaces is a known process of photometric stereo. The above discussed methods face problems with varying light directions. Both methods do not support the observations of Lambertian surface without shadowing. This technique considers every image as Lambertian surface and gathers three or more images from 3dimensionality in high dimension as the training dataset to compute shortest distance of the image space. The advantages of this technique limit only to Lambertian surfaces. \n",
        "\n",
        "4. Fisherface is the creative idea which takes the advantages of both approaches given above. In Fisherface, labelled training set make use of reliable results from previous methods to reduce dimensionality of feature space using class specific method which gives more clear recognition than Eigenface and Linear Subspace.Fisher Linear Discriminant (FLD) is one of the Class Specific method which tries to “Shape” scatter to make better for classification.\n",

        "The Face recognition problem deals with Within Class Scatter matrix    is always singular. The number of images in learning set is very smaller than pixel in each image. Thus, to choosing W is possible by making exactly Zero to the Within Class Scatter matrix of the projected Samples. To overcome this criteria, Fisherface projects image to lower Dimensional Space which gives non-singular within class scatter. PCA achieves N-c where as FLD tries to reduce dimensionality to C-1.\n",
        "The given research work was very innovative at the time of publishing as it did not have any other algorithms which could solve facial recognition problems. This research paper focused problems on lighting direction, number of sources of light and facial expression. It was a novel solution to address this but, now there are certain advanced techniques has been derived from the Fisherface and fisher Linear Discrimination to resolve face recognition System. One such example is “Multi-Directional Multi-Level Dual-Cross Patterns for Robust Face Recognition” (MDML-DCP) which is a derivative of gaussian Operator which reduce the impact of variation in illumination (Ding et al. 2016). \n",

        "\n",
        "Firstly, the authors of the chosen paper outlined the difficulties arrived using Face recognition algorithm. They pointed observation from the algorithm to be achieved. Clearly stating the problem and accordingly, they examined four pattern classification techniques under variation in lighting and facial expression to solve and compare the results. This makes a reader get quick notion about the topic and problems with methods. \n",
        "\n",
        "Secondly, going through the paper, it shows disadvantages of the existing problem is listed for each method and considering these, proposed solution achieving criteria. Moreover, comparisons of PCA and FLD were done for two class problem where sample from each class and plotted graph with satisfying mathematical calculations. In addition to that, they used subset of the Harvard database and a database created at Yale to understand the variation in lighting and facial expressions. This shows that they tried to achieve accuracy in each method with different inputs which reflects good analysis.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Thirdly, authors presented certain experimental results using different hypothesis like Glass recognition, facial expression and eye wear showing different subsets in which they proposed that Fisher face low error rates and less computational time. However, the results can be more appropriate showing how the error rates were calculated and exact calculation time. Overall the quality of performing experimental hypothesis is satisfactory. \n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, they have concluded that saying Fisher face method is the best extrapolating and interpolating over variation in lighting. This reflects they have jumped to final results without elaborating the method and experimental results. Overall the technicality of paper is quite good to understand the concepts regarding Facial recognition. \n",

        "Authors used specific approach based on the problems of the face recognition. They adopted Fisherface algoriyhm derived from FLD to resolve variation in lighting and facial expression. Hence the specific approach has been incorporated to specific domain. FLD shows more accuracy compared to other approaches in applied datasets. However preferred approach fails when there are extreme light variations. \n",

        "The proposed research is promising, and it can be further developed if it collects the dataset from different fields to obtain threshold accuracy and investigation should done to withstand solution in extreme variation in lighting. It is a challenging task when shadow dominates in the images. Now the research should  conducted to investigate the representation of images under all illuminating projections that forms Convex illumination lying close to low dimensional space. \n",
